It a Naive-Bayes classifier written in python. Its a supervised learning technique based on Bayes Theorem. It assumes all features of a feature vector to be independent of each other.

The feature vector belongs to the class which has maximum posterior probability:

Posterior Probability = (Likelihood * Prior Probability)/(Evidence)

Wikipedia Description:

A naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions. A more descriptive term for the underlying probability model would be "independent feature model".
